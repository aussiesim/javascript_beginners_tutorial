        That box up there? That's a HTML canvas element. We're going to learn how to draw and animate
        stuff in there.<br/>
        Along the way, we're going to learn about variables, flow control, how to accept user input and
        some other cool things. You might even pick up some basics of HTML and CSS along the way.<br/>
