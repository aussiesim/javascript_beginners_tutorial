    When the page is finished loading it will automatically run whatever 
    is in the 'onload' event for the body. So in this case it executes the
    JavaScript command to create a popup alert that simply says 'Hello World!'
    with an OK button.

            This is going to be a series of very basic web pages that combine together to create a complete
            beginner's JavaScript tutorial. What makes this tutorial different? It's intended to be a little
            more fun than the majority of tutorials out there. We are going to be using the HTML canvas a lot
            because being able to see things move tends to make things more interesting.
