    When the page is finished loading it will automatically run whatever
    is in the 'onload' event for the body. So in this case it executes the
    JavaScript command to create a popup alert that simply says 'Hello World!'
    with an OK button.

            This is going to be a series of very basic web pages that combine together to create an introductory
            beginner's JavaScript tutorial. What makes this tutorial different? It's intended to be a little
            more fun and faster paced than the majority of tutorials out there. I'm going to assume that you
            have a pretty good head on your shoulders and that you are keen to get things happening at a rapid
            rate so I am going to intentionally gloss over some things, but don't worry! One of the most valuable
            tools in every software developers kit is the ability to use Google to search for relevant keywords, so
            at the bottom of each page I will include some relevant search suggestions if you are keen to go a little
            more in depth.

            Because of the nature of webpages and JavaScript, what you see in your browser is only part of the
            tutorial - a bit like a car, it's what's under the hood that really powers the page so be sure to check out
            the source code... Just right-click on the page and select "View Source" or, even better, "Inspect".

            We are going to be using the HTML canvas a lot because being able to see things move tends to make things
            more interesting.
